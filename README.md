# Phrase_Hunter_Game
 Fourth Fullstack JavaScript Techdegree Project 

The focus of this project was using classes to represent the Game as well as the Phrase to be guessed. 

The Game phrase includes methods that starts the game, selects a random phrase, handles letter select events, checks if the player is a winner, and displays the win or loss screen.

The Phrase class includes methods that add the phrase to the display, checks if selected letters are in the phrase, removes lives, and displays the correct chosen letters. 

In addition, I was able to use the library animate.css to add different animations to the start overlay screen.
